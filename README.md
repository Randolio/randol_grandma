# Randolio: Grandma (Rewrite) 18/02/2024

**ESX now supported with bridge**

A way for players to get revived in your server without the need of a hospital (crim based). 

**NOTE**: Support for qbox is unlikely, I'm not sure how they handle ambulance stuff now.

## Requirements

* [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/tag/v3.16.2)
